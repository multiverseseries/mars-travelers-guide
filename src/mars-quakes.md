title: Mars Quakes, Volcanoes and Catastrophe

3 billion years ago when our solar system was young, Mars was a very different planet.

What was this planet like? Was it home to life?

Ancient Mars was volcanically and likely tectonically active, rocked by meteor impacts triggering
immense Mars Quakes which tore the landscape asunder.

Would you like to hear one? Don’t worry, it’s safe.

We created this sound from a small Mars quake recorded by the Insight Lander in 2022, scaled up to
simulate a high magnitude event (credit Amir Khan, ETH Zurich). Transposed up by 13 octaves, you can
literally hear the planet itself ringing like a bell. Seismologists call these the ‘normal modes’ of
the planet.

The two planets ring in very different ways! For the “Thunderous Dance” of Mars Symphony, we turned
the resonances of the planet itself into a thunderous melody:

But why do Earth and Mars resonate so differently? It’s all down to the planetary core…
