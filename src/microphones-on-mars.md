title: Microphones on Mars

Today Mars is a desert planet, much like Arrakis of Herbert’s Dune (although no sandworms have been
reported). Although we cannot yet visit in person, we can experience what it’s like to be on our
neighboring world through images, and most recently - through sound!

This is incredibly exciting for music loves, as sound connects us to our world in such a direct
physical and emotional way. Mars Symphony begins with the real sounds of Mars recorded by the
Perseverance Rover and Insight Lander:

**Martian Wind**

**Dust Devil**

**Seismic Waves**

**Micro Asteroid Impact**

To become members of the symphony orchestra, these sounds can be transformed into Martian Synths to
play melodies and harmonies. Here we use resonant filters to play a familiar tune:

**Martian Wind Synth**

When the asteroid strikes, we are jolted back in time 3 billion years to when Mars had liquid water
and was a twin world to Earth…
