Right now, NASA’s Perseverance rover is collecting a set of diverse Martian rock and soil samples,
which we all hope will make their way back to Earth on a future Mars Sample Return mission.

_Will the samples show evidence of life - present or ancient - on Mars?_

We won’t know until they return! The cores are just the width of a quarter, and each has a unique
story to tell about Mars. To help us appreciate their mineralogy, we’ve translated their grains into
sound in a new method of sonification that is similar to playing them like a record.

As the line travels clockwise over the grains, it causes notes to be played by our orchestra. Grains
at the edge trigger high notes, grain in the center trigger low notes, with each mineral played by a
different instrument.

The Atmo Mountain core contains Martian sand and loose regolith carried by the wind - likely
sandstone similar to earth. In the sonification, the flute and wind section respond to the larger
clasts:
