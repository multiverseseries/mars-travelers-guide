Recent Mars missions have revealed the presence of liquid water in ancient times - perhaps planetary
oceans like modern Earth. What could have gone so catastrophically wrong?

It wasn’t the marsquakes or erupting volcanoes. Instead, the leading theories to explain Mars’ loss
of water blame the loss of its magnetic field and atmosphere.

We are lucky to live on earth. Our magnetic field protects us from harmful ionizing radiation from
the sun, and gifts us the beautiful Aurous Borealis and Australis at Earth’s poles.

Without this protection, the Sun’s radiation would strip away our atmosphere atom by atom, molecule
by molecule - leaving us exposed to the harshness of space.

The result of a weak magnetic field? The frigid desert that is modern day Mars, unable to hold heat
or a substantial atmosphere.

An atmosphere is a fragile thing, and should not be taken for granted.
